Paper abstract
-------
Historical newspapers are a novel source of information for historical ecologists to study the interactions between humans and an- imals through time and space. Newspaper archives, especially, are in- teresting to analyse because of the width and depth of their collections. However, the size and the occasional noisiness of such archives also brings difficulties, as manual analysis is impossible. In this paper, we present ex- periments and results on automatic query expansion and categorisation for the perception of animal species between 1800 and 1940. For query expansion and to the manual annotation process, we used lexicons. For the categorisation we trained a Support Vector Machine model. Our re- sults indicate that we can distinguish newspaper articles that are about animal species from those that are not with an F1 of 0.92 and the sub- categorisation of the different types of newspapers on animals up to 0.84 F1.
